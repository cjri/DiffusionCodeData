# DiffusionCodeData
Data to accompany the DiffusionCode project

Files provided are in multiple formats.  .count files represent counts of individuals infected with specific bottleneck sizes.  The term phi in a file description refers to the value of the parameter \phi_env for the office environment, for which see Supplementary Methods 1, and particularly section 1.4, of our manuscript.  Specifying \phi_env for the office implied effective viral loads, which are reported in the manuscript.

In file names the code _vmX_ describes results under an X-fold increase in the volume of particles emitted.

Exposures files represent relative physical exposures of each of the uninfected individuals in an environment (shown as columns) over time, measured each second for a period of one hour.  Separate files detail exposures to particles of different sizes at the time of emission, in units of 1um radius.
